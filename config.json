      "survey_description": "*Please be advised that this survey is resource-intensive and demands significant RAM for optimal performance. To avoid potential slowdowns, ensure all open windows and background programs are closed. Additionally, a stable internet connection is necessary for smooth operation.*  \n\nThe research will be conducted among beneficiaries of the Digitrans program, targeting micro and small firms with 5 to 35 employees from all sectors, with at least 12 months of business history, and at a foundational level of digital sophistication. Eligible program beneficiaries will be assigned to one of the following groups: \n- Group 1. Receiving a Financial Subsidy reimbursing costs of digital tools for general business functions up to EUR 2,000. \n- Group 2. Receiving both a Financial Subsidy and a Technical Assistance: an 8 weeks long training and advisory program focused on building technological capabilities, and learning Change Management skills to define problems, formulate solutions, prepare for investments in digital technologies, test them, and evaluate returns from investment in digital tools. \n- Group 3. Receiving Benchmarking Report on digitalization level. Benchmarking reports will be extended to firms in all three Groups. \n\nBy comparing beneficiaries who receive only Financial Subsidy (Group 1) against those who receive both Financial Subsidy and Technical Assistance (Group 2), as well as those receiving only a Benchmarking Report (Group 3), we seek to establish causal relationships between the financial and non-financial support and outcomes such as the level of digitalization, firm sales, and profits. This comparison will help determine the impact of the Financial Subsidy, the added value of Technical Assistance, against the effect of receiving only the Benchmarking Report. \n\nThe following questions regard your beliefs on the likely impact of the Financial Subsidy combined with Technical Assistance (Group 2), in comparison with being offered the Financial Subsidy alone (Group 1), or the Benchmarking Report (Group 3), regardless of whether a firm decides to participate in it. These questions ask for your opinion on how the outcomes might differ, on average, for firms in the different groups."
